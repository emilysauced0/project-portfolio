            Hi there my name is Emily, I'm 24 years old and I'm starting my new journey into the world of coding and developing.
            I currently reside in Sacramento, CA where I work in the grocery business as an overnight
            freight crew manager. I have been in my position for 3 years now and worked mostly in retail before
            that. I'm improving my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this is just the beginning and I hope to learn so 
            much more!
